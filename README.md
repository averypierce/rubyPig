#### Piggy is a network tool that receives, filters, and sends messages to other piggy instances in order to monitor or process data 
 * Defined a simple protocol for pig-nodes to send each other messages and metadata 
 * Utilized good design practices to make code highly extensible   
 * Implemented a feature to reestablish communication chain if any pig-nodes are disconnected 
 
 *Tools used: Ruby, TCP*
